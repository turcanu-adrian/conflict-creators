# Conflict Creators

A Family Feud-like game made in ReactJS that is to be played on a Twitch livestream, against Twitch chat.

## Gamemodes

### 1. Parasocial Confrontation

* 1v1 gamemode in which the streamer competes against their community
* Each round, a random player from the chat is selected to represent the community and play against the streamer
* 3 rounds total, 3 strikes max per round
* The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins


### 2. Creator Check
* Highscore-based gamemode in which the streamer competes against their community
* Each round the streamer must guess the 4 most popular answers to a survey question
* The game ends when the streamer reaches 3 strikes
